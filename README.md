# Community Market Hub

A simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application that connects local shop owners with nearby customers.  
The platform allows shop owners to list products and prices, while customers can search, browse, and compare goods available in their area.

## üåç Project Overview
In many communities, especially in Africa, small shops sell essentials but lack online visibility. Customers often don‚Äôt know which shop has what product, or at what price.  
**Community Market Hub** solves this by creating a lightweight platform where:
- Shop owners can register and upload their products with prices.
- Customers can browse or search for items and see nearby shops that stock them.
- The app promotes local trade and helps customers save time and money.
